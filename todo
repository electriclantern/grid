you are an amnesiac AI managing a broken intergalactic transportation system.

gameplay: resource management, hitman-like open-ended strategy, uncoverable mysteries in the game world

aesthetic: organic. scrappy. dry. light.

goal: get the helixes back in working order


TO DO

system layout (grid inputs) (what the heck do i call this)
v x (failed & successful transmission)
- h (helix info, eight galaxies)
	[H1] [H2] [H3]		<- upper class/igsp-reserved priority helixes
	[H4] [  ] [H5]		<- normal passenger helixes
	[H6] [H7] [H8]		<- cargo helixes

	clicking on any one of the helixes shows you the current galaxy they're at
	clicking again sends you to the helix info & control
	clicking on the galaxy sends you to galaxies menu. click on one to see which helixes are in it
- i (systems info, preferences)
	log (dates, helix stops, .alerts)
	stasis (go to pre-title screen)
	model info (info on the ai. who created it; credits. when it was last updated)
	preferences

npc
- helix loops
	priority helixes go directly to necessary location without stopping
	every ten minutes passenger helixes stop at a galaxy for a minute
	every ten minutes cargo helixes stop for fifteen minutes
	(5s = 1s in game time)
- relevant npc designs, their loops & reactions
	revolutionaries in the top priority helix
	dangerous creatures & their warden being transported in cargo helixes
- helix-specific dialogue loops & general dialogue loops
	.alert dialogue that pops up as messages from the system
	you can tune into every helix? you are tuned into H8 by defaultâ€”that's what it was last tuned into
- systems and npc interaction

story
- endings
	bad ending: you do nothing. everybody dies.
- characters
- pacing; a variety in gameplay, a goal at all times

polishing
- sfx & music (make taps sound nicer)
- solidify general aesthetic
- animations
- color palette
- character voices (vocal chops)
- autosave
- size & cross platform accessibility
